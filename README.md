## About

FreeBuild is an free and open source project that aims to provide a set of building blocks that can be combined in a modular fashion. The blocks should be strong, light-weight, and conserve material wherever possible. Block should also be printable on most consumer 3D Printers.

## Liability Waiver

By using and or printing these blocks you release the contributor(s) of any liability. (Your house burns down, your printer explodes, or what-have you.) These blocks could pose a choking hazard. Be smart, eh?

# FreeBuild Development

If you want to get started in FreeBuild development, download [FreeCAD](http://free-cad.sourceforge.net/). Right now each block folder contains a picture, FreeCAD file format, and standard mesh .obj format.

## FreeBuild Block Specs

The team is currently working on drafting a v 0.1 block and connector specifications and design.
